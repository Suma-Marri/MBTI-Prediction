1474147029035393026,2021-12-23 22:36:54,1,0,@IndiGo6E Update. There was no wheelchair to take my grandmother to the 23rd seat. She was panting all the way. Also my mother singlehanded handled 7 suitcases when she landed cuz they were checked in but we weren’t on the flight. Bravo. 👏 happy to make ur profit margins increase.

Unfortunately that lady’s behaviour today was bad human conduct. let’s not even talk about “service”. And I’ve never complained to any company before. I always let things go. This one I took the time to write about.
